        <p class="godtitle">Thor, The Norse God of Lightning</p>
        <p class="godinfo">Thor is another notable god of the Norse Pantheon. He is a tall, courageous man, and the ideal that most warriors looked up to. He is the defender of the Aesir gods and protects their fortress, Asgard from giants, the main enemies of the gods. Thor has many notable feats, such as the time he was challenged by Utgard-Loki(who is not the god of mischief loki, but a "friendly" giant) to consume all of the liquid in a drinking horn. Thor could not decline the challenge and drank from it, but what he didn't know was that the drinking horn was one with the ocean, and by drinking from it, he had managed to lower the whole world's ocean leve;. After this display from Thor, and his companions, he was informed by Utgard-Loki to leave and never come back due to the sheer amount of fear instilled in him. </p>
