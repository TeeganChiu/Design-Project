        <p class="godtitle">Hades, Greek God of the Underworld</p>
        <p class="godinfo">Hades is the god of the Underworld and the dead, and the eldest brother of the 6 children of Kronos. He is often seen as evil, but in mythology he actually isn't that bad, he's just a guy tasked with keeping the dead in check, he doesn't usually punish them unless they deserve it. One of the worst things he did was when he abducted the daughter of Demeter, Persephone. People still debate whether she went willingly or not, but either way it threw Demeter into a rage and she refused to let anything grow and placed the world into an eternal winter until Persephone came back, which she did after she agreed to spend 6 months in the underworld and 6 months with her mother.</p>
