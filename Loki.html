        <p class="godtitle">Loki, The Trickster God</p>
        <p class="godinfo">Although Loki is considered an Aesir god, he technically is only a demigod, since his father was actually a giant while his mother was a goddess. Loki is the trickster god and god of mischief, he is one of the main characters in all of Norse mythology due to his habit of creating problems. For example, he is responsable for some of the biggest threats of Ragnarok, Jormungand, The serpent the size of the world who kills Thor during Ragnarok, Fenrir, the wolf who grows incredibly fast who kills Odin during Ragnarok, Hel, the goddess of the Underworld and Sleipnir, an 8 legged horse that is a gift to Odin as a gift. </p>
