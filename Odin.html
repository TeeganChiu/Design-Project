        <p class="godtitle">Odin, The Allfather</p>
        <p class="godinfo">Odin is the god at the top of the Norse Pantheon of gods, and was given the title "The Allfather" due to him being the father or father figure of a majority of the aesir gods. Odin is also known as "One eyed Odin" due to the fact that he only has one eye. This occured due to his search for wisdom, and his willingness to give anything to aquire said wisdom, where he ventured to Mimir's well, near the roots of the world tree Yggdrasil, where Mimir told him that he could not drink from the well unless he offered up his eye. Odin then gouged out his eye and dropped it into the well, then was allowed to drink from the well.</p>
